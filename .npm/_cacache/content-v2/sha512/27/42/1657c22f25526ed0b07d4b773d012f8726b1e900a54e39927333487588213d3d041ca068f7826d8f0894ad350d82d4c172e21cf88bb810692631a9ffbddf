utility (no external dependencies) for finding the path of a package across different node versions.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save @rigor789/resolve-package-path\n# or \nyarn add @rigor789/resolve-package-path\n# or\npnpm add @rigor789/resolve-package-path\n```\n\n---\n\nThe reason this exists is because `require.resolve(\"<packageName>/package.json\")` can fail if a package defines `exports` in their `package.json` and does not include `package.json`.\n\nSome details on the issue can be found here: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33460\n\nThis package works around the issue by:\n1. first trying a regular `require.resolve(\"<packageName>/package.json\")`\n2. then falling back to `require.resolve(\"<packageName>\")` and finding the last index of `node_modules/<packageName>`\n3. finally falls back to the same `require.resolve(\"<packageName>\")` and a filesystem traversal upwards until a matching package.json is found\n4. if the package is not found, returns `false`\n\n# API\n\n## resolvePackagePath(packageName: string, options?)\n\nResolves the package path. Options accepts anything that `require.resovle(\"\", options)` accepts. [See Node Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options)\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst { resolvePackagePath } = require(\"@rigor789/resolve-package-path\");\n\nconsole.log(resolvePackagePath('package-a'))         // /path/to/package-a\nconsole.log(resolvePackagePath('@scoped/package-a')) // /path/to/@scoped/package-a\n```\n\n## resolvePackageJSONPath(packageName: string, options?)\n\nSame as `resolvePackagePath` but returns the path to the `package.json` instead.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst { resolvePackageJSONPath } = require(\"@rigor789/resolve-package-path\");\n\nconsole.log(resolvePackageJSONPath('package-a'))         // /path/to/package-a/package.json\nconsole.log(resolvePackageJSONPath('@scoped/package-a')) // /path/to/@scoped/package-a/package.json\n```\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
